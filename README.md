Comparing Splay Trees and Optimal Binary Search Trees

Idea:  One of the major open problems in Data Structures is whether Splay Trees are 
competitive with Optimal Binary Search Trees. The goal of this project is to 
implement each data structure and compare them on sequences of dictionary data 
structure operations.
Details:  Implement each data structure and compare on sequences of operations.  
Analyze your results.   See if you can design input sequences which are hard for each 
structure.  Report your findings in a “lab report.”
